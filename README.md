A very simple drum module for Raspberry Pi Pico designed to be used with the Behringer RD-6 trigger outputs.

Copy config.py.dist to config.py and alter to suit your needs

Use an "Arduino voltage sensor" to reduce the 15v trigger to less than 3.3v for the Pico ADCs and and I2C DAC for audio output (such as https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/pico-audio-pack)
